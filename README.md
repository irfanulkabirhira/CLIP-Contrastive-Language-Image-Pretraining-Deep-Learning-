CLIP basic to Advance on Chest-X-Ray [TB]

✅ What is CLIP? 
CLIP stands for Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining. It was introduced by OpenAI in 2021. 
Core Idea:  
CLIP learns to match images and text by training on millions of (image, caption) pairs. It learns a shared space where 
related image-text pairs are close, and unrelated ones are far. 
How it works: 
• An image encoder (e.g., ViT or ResNet). 
• A text encoder (e.g., Transformer or BERT). 
• It learns by contrastive loss: 
o Pushes matching pairs together. 
o Pushes non-matching apart. 
✅ Why Use CLIP? 
CLIP is versatile and powerful because: 
Reason 
Zero/Few-shot Learning    
Benefit 
No need for large labeled datasets 
Multimodal Understanding    Understands text and image together 
Transferable    
Works well even on unseen tasks 
Low annotation cost    
No need to label 1000s of medical images 
In medical AI, this is huge because labeling X-rays is expensive and requires radiologists. 
✅ Types / Variants of CLIP 
Variant 
Original CLIP 
Description 
Trained on internet images + captions 
MedCLIP 
BioViL 
GLoRIA 
CheXzero 
MedCLIP-2D, BioCLIP, 
etc. 
Trained on medical image–text (MIMIC-CXR, 
etc.) 
Biomedical Vision-Language 
Aligns global + local regions 
Zero-shot classification of CXR 
Variants of MedCLIP with better tuning 
Use-case 
Generic image-text matching 
Chest X-ray reports, radiology 
Medical images + text reports 
Better for localized findings 
Best for zero-shot disease 
detection 
Higher performance on small 
datasets 
✅ Official CLIP Models by OpenAI 
These are trained on general web image-text pairs: 
Model Name 
ViT-B/32 
Description 
Vision Transformer (Base) with 32×32 patches — Fastest, common default. 
ViT-B/16 
ViT-L/14 
Higher resolution (16×16 patches) — Better performance. 
Larger model, better accuracy — Slower but more powerful. 
ViT- L/14@336px      Larger input size (336px) — Highest accuracy.   
RN50, RN101 
ResNet backbones — Older, less popular than ViT. 
✅ Which CLIP Model to Use for Medical Datasets? 
Dataset 
MIMIC-CXR 
CheXpert 
NIH ChestX-ray14 
Recommended Model 
Why 
MedCLIP / BioViL / GLoRIA  Trained on or designed for chest X-rays 
CheXzero  
MedCLIP / BioViL                     
TB Datasets (like yours) MedCLIP or CheXzero  
General Medical 
BioViL / GLoRIA  
Trained/tested for zero-shot on CheXpert 
Large scale, MedCLIP handles this well 
Both generalize well, even to unseen diseases 
Broader coverage of anatomy and disease types 
Which Model Should we use and Why ?? 
✅ PART 1: What Are the Official CLIP Models by OpenAI? 
These are general-purpose CLIP models trained by OpenAI on 400M image–text pairs from the internet 
(non-medical). They're great for general vision tasks, but not specialized for medical images.

CNN 
backbones 
Best accuracy 
Familiar for classic CV 
users 
Weaknesses 
Lower resolution → 
lower accuracy 
Slower than B/32 
Bigger model → more 
compute 
Slowest, highest GPU 
need 
Lower performance vs 
ViTs 
Used for: General images — dogs, buildings, cars, memes, etc. 
Not trained on X-rays, CTs, MRIs → worse performance on medical data. 
✅ PART 2: Why Do We Use MedCLIP, CheXzero, BioViL, etc. for 
Medical Data? 
These models are built on top of CLIP concepts but trained with medical-specific data: 
Model 
MedCLIP           
Based On 
CLIP-style ViT     
Trained With 
MIMIC-CXR (chest X-rays)                    
CheXzero  CLIP + T5-style text encoder    CheXpert + radiology text                    
BioViL      
CLIP-like ViT + BERT      
GLoRIA ViT + Local–Global attention           
Biomedical images + text              
Biomedical data          
These models still follow the CLIP architecture style: 
• Visual encoder (ViT or CNN) 
• Text encoder (BERT, T5, etc.) 
• Contrastive loss: Match image ↔ text 
But they’re trained specifically for: 
• Radiology reports 
• Medical image datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, etc.) 
Best For 
TB, NIH, MIMIC, general CXRs 
Zero-shot on CheXpert, TB 
General biomedical vision-language tasks 
Fine-grained disease localization + general use 
• Better terminology understanding ("pneumothorax", "opacity", "nodule", etc.) 
So Which Should You Use? 
• For TB Chest X-rays or similar: 
Need 
Zero-shot classification 
Use 
✅ CheXzero (no retraining needed) 
Few-shot with own classifier 
✅ MedCLIP (feature extraction + Logistic Regression) 
General biomedical tasks ✅ BioViL or GLoRIA
